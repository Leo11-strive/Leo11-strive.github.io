Time complexity and rounding errors are the two main concerns. Therefore, we need to find a way to accelerate the convergence of the series. To make this $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k(k+1)}$ converge faster, we need dominator exponent of $k$ as large as possible, without losing any accuracy. We can acquire the precise result of the progression when $x$ is an interger. Therefore, we may multiply $k+t$ when $t\\in N$ to both the numerator and the dominator, then seperate the series into various parts. I suggest $t$ has a relationship with the specific $x$, personally I prefer $t=\\lfloor x \\rfloor$. Then you may acquire a remain unsolved series, and some series that can be calculated precisely, with their x being integers. The dominator of the unsolved series must have a exponent of $k$ larger or equal to 4. Then apply loops to solve the series.","link":"/2025/01/10/NA/"},{"title":"Intro","text":"Welcome to my blog!
